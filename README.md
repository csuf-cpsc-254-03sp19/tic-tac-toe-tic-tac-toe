## Compiling
Linux


Use your package manager to install SDL2 and SDL2mixer e.g. ```apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev``` for Ubuntu/Debian or yum install SDL2-devel SDL2_mixer-devel for Fedora/CentOS.


Next run make to compile. Once finished you can run make run to start the application. If you would like to install the application, run make install with elevated privileges e.g. sudo make install. Finally, running make uninstall with elevated privileges can be used to uninstall the application.
